Hacking The Maplin Function Generator
=====================================

The Maplin Function Generator is supplied in kit form, consisting of
an AtTiny2313 microcontroller, an 8-bit D/A converter formed from the
microcontroller's PORTB outputs and an R/2R ladder, and two buffering
amplifiers for the output.

The kit can generate sine, square, triangle and sawtooth waveforms, with
a maximum frequency of approximately 50kHz. It might actually go higher than
this, but once I took a look at the quality of the signal it generated, I
determined straight away that it needed some serious attention. So out 
came the Arduino.

What I found was essentially three issues:

1. The generated frequency was not stable. It seemed to ramp up in discrete
increments over the course of three or four seconds.

2. The generated signal was not continuous - there was a pause in the signal
every few milliseconds.

3. The quality of the signal was poor - there were large steps in the output.

The first issue was clearly a bug in the code. The second indicated the presence
of an interrupt handler polling the buttons used to set the mode and frequency, 
and the last issue was due to insufficient precision in the stored COS table
used to generate the sine wave.

With the modifications I describe here, the hacked generator now has the following
specifications:

 - Waveforms generated to full 8-bit precision up to 50kHz
 - Selectable output filtering, giving cleaner signals
 - Two-speed frequency increase/decrease, with LED indication of the speed
   of change and max/min limits
   
Of course, everything comes at a price. In this case you lose a feature:

  - No signal is generated while the frequency is being changed
  
You also need to add 2 diodes and, optionally, one capacitor.

I'm now going to discuss the maths behind digital direct synthesis (DDS), before
describing the modifications. If you don't care and just want to know how to get
the shiny new features (and how to send me a cheque..) you can skip ahead now.

Discussion Of DDS Synthesis
----------------------------

There are essentially two ways a digital circuit can synthesise a signal:

  - Calculate the correct value of the signal at every instant 
  - Use a lookup table
  
There are also interesting combinations of the two, but since anything involving
calculation either involves custom hardware (not an option) or is really slow, our
choice is to use the lookup table method.

Imagine a sine wave of amplitude A. If you calculate its value at
equal intervals over an entire period (360 degress or 2pi radians), and there are N
intervals, you will have constructed a lookup table.

Now to generate a sine wave, you simply take a value from the table and send it to your 
DAC to convert to a voltage level. Then you wait for a short time t before taking the 
next value from the table and sending that to the DAC. It's easy to see that if you do
this (looping back to the first entry in the table when you get to the end) you
generate  a signal at the output which is a sine wave with frequency f = 1/Nt.

What does this signal look like in terms of fidelity? There are two parts to this:
first, the resolution of the DAC controls the number of steps in the output - the more
accurate the DAC, the cleaner the output; second the resolution of the wave table in terms
of how many entries there are determines both the effective resolution of the output signal
in amplitude, but also how accurately in time the changes from step to step occur.

The kit implements an 8-bit DAC using precision resistors in an R/2R ladder, so that is
something we can't improve.

Let's look in more detail at the errors due to the size (number of samples) of the 
wave table and the the times at which the wave table is sampled.

At first sight, we might say that since we have an N-bit DAC then we need a wave-table
with N bits of address - or 2^N samples. For dramatic effect, here's a picture of a sine
wave table with 4-bits of resolution and 16 samples:

     --- diagram ----
     
And here's the actual table of values:

     --- table of values ----
     
You can clearly see that at the zero-crossings the wave-table is horribly inaccurate - the
values jump from 0 to 3 in one step, effectively losing two bits of resolution at the crossing.
Let's put more samples into the table - make it 32 samples (5-bit address):

    -- 5-bit table  ----
    
We're still missing some steps at the crossing. Finally here's a 64 sample table (6-bit
address)

   -- 6-bit table ---
   
Finally, we're using the full precision of our 4-bit DAC. You can repeat this exercise
for any number (N) of bits of resolution and you'll find that in order to use them all, you 
need a table with 2^N+2 entries. So for our purposes we need a table with 2^10 or 1024
entries.

We're not finished yet though. Because of the repetitive nature of a sine wave, we don't
actually need to store one complete cycle. We could store only a half or even a quarter
and use that to generate the 'missing' values. In this case I've opted for a table with
512 entries as a good tradeoff between table size and code size (you need to do more
work in the code to use a 1/4 size table, hence you generate lower frequencies than for
a 1/2 size table).

Now let's look at the accuracy in time of when we send our samples to the DAC. First we
need to go into a bit more detail on how we generate our address into the sample table.

Remember how we said that if we send each succeeding sample from the table to the DAC
every t seconds, we would generate a signal with frequency f = 1/Nt? This means that in
order to generate different frequencies we need to be able to change the value of t.
One way of doing that would be to have code which looks like this:

unsigned int addr = 0;
unsigned int delay = xxx;

while(true) {
  writeToDac(readFromTableAtPosition(addr));           // 2 cycles
  addr = addr + 1;                                     // 1 cycle
  // wait for the delay time to control the frequency
  for(int i=0; i<delay; i++) {                         // 2 cycles
    // do nothing                                      // 1 cycle
  }
}

That would work, but at high frequencies we would have very poor control over the delay.
I've put some imaginary number of cycles to execute each line of code. You can see that
with a delay of zero, each sample is sent to the dac every 6 cycles. With a delay of 1, 
each sample is sent every 7 cycles - a 16% change for the smallest delay increment.

As you might have guessed, this isn't how a DDS is implemented. In fact the change is
very simple. We use two values: the phaseAddress and the phaseIncrement. 

We figure out which entry in the wave table to use by dividing the phaseAddress by 
some number D.

What is phase noise?

OK. Enough theory.

The Implementation - Hardware
-------------------------------

First of all, the hardware. Here's the circuit diagram. The highlighted parts are
my additions. As you can see, they consist of two diodes and a capacitor.

The diodes form a basic OR-gate, so that when any of the three buttons is pressed, the
input pin PD2 is pulled low. This is used to generate an interrupt to force the generator
to break out of the synthesis loops. Using interrupts in this way rather than have the 
processor continually scan the buttons for presses means that the output signal is 
constant as long as no buttons are pressed.

The capacitor is connected to PINA1 which is configured either in tristate - in which 
case the capacitor has no effect on the output signal, or as an output drive low - in
which case the capacitor acts as a low-pass filter, smoothing out the transitions from
one step to the next and giving a cleaner output signal.

The Implementation - Software
-------------------------------

In order to make this hack as easy as possible, the code is written as an Arduino sketch
and you can use an Arduino as a programmer to load the code into the AtTiny2313. I could
have got more features into the code, and a higher maximum generated frequency, if I'd
written the software completely in assembler. However the Atmel IDE only runs on Windows
and my PCs only run Linux, so I chose to go the Arduino route. If I did this from scratch
I'd use a DsPIC (70MHz! IDE runs on Linux! In-circuit debugging!)

The complete code is attached. It is divided into three parts:

  - initialization
  - key scanning and control (the user interface)
  - wave generation
  
Initialization
---------------
This is simple. It turns off the interrupts from the timer (disabling the Arduino millis()
function), and set the pins to inputs and outputs as necessary.

The interesting one is the use of PA0. I need a way to get my interrupt routine to tell
the synthesis loops to stop running. So when the processor gets an interrupt from one of
the buttons, it sets PA0 to '1'. Every cycle round the synthesis loop this bit is tested
and if it is set, the loop exits. This is marginally faster than setting a global variable
and checking that in the loop since it doesn't involve a memory read.

Key Scanning and Control
-------------------------
An interrupt causes the synthesis loop to stop, and the arduino loop() function starts
to run as normal. Every time the loop runs the global ticks variable is incremented by 1,
and this is used as a timer for button debouncing and measuring how long a button is
pressed.

Button operation is as follows:

F+ : a short press increments the generated frequency by a set amount. This amount
     varies as follows. 
     Below 100Hz increments by 1Hz per click
     Above 100Hz increments by 10Hz per click
     Above 1KHz  increments by 100Hz per click
     Above 10KHz increments by 1KHz per click
     
   : a press of longer than 1 second causes the frequency to increment continuously
     by the equivalent of 5 short clicks per second.
     The LEDs indicate this by all being blanked, except the SQ LED which flashes
     
   : a press of longer than 3 seconds causes the frequency to increment continuously
     by the equivalent of 20 short clicks per second.
     The SINE LED flashes.
     Once the maximum frequency is reached, the SINE LED remains lit without flashing.
     
F- : works analogously to F+, but decreasing frequency.

Function : A short press cycles through the signal waveforms.
         : A long press enables mode setting in this mode the function LEDs flash 
           to indicate
           SINE - When lit, the output filtering capacitor is enabled
                  Toggled by pressing F+
           SQUARE - lit to indicate the output filtering is disabled
                  
           TRIANGLE - When lit, under-sampling is enabled for frequencies above xxKHz
                    Toggled by pressing F-
           SAWTOOTH - Lit to indicate that under-sampling is diabled
                    
          : Once the relevant modes have been enabled, a second press of the Function 
            button will return the other buttons to their normal operation. 
            
Installing the Hardware Mods
-----------------------------

This is pretty simple really. First, remove the AtTiny from its socket and plug it
in to your Arduino breadboard. You could use an earthing strap if you are paranoid.

Now solder the two diodes and capacitor in place on the underside of the board as shown
in the photo. Diodes should be small-signal diodes. E.g. 1N914 or 1N4148.
Capacitor should be around 220pF.

Once the AtTiny has been reprogrammed, remove it from the Arduino breadboard and plug it
back into the generator socket and you're ready to go.
